## Description

A simple, text-based RPG created using Node.js, test-driven development, and object-oriented programming

## Installation Instructions

node.js installation
Make sure that you have node.js installed on your computer by entering node -v in the command line. If successful, the command prompt will return a version number. If not, try reinstalling Node.js by following this link: https://nodejs.org/en/ and clicking on the LTS version. If you are on Windows, make sure to look for the section that says Download for Windows (x64). If you are using macOS, make sure to look for the section that says Download for MacOS (x64)

Clone the code
Once node.js is downloaded, click on the green code button and copy the link to this repository. Then open up your favorite code editor and open the terminal. In the terminal use cd to go to the root directory you want this repository to be cloned to. Finally, in the terminal, type git clone <file link> to clone this repository to your directory.

Inquirer
You must also install the Inquirer npm package to see the portfolio. Since Inquirer is an npm package instead of being built directly into node.js, you must type npm init into the command line to allow npm packages to be installed. Next, go to the app.js file, and in the command line, type npm install inquirer to install Inquirer on your computer. For documentation on Inquirer or other npm packages, follow this link: https://www.npmjs.com/ and type the npm you want to search in the search bar.

## Usage Instructions

After installing the required npm packages, use the command line to navigate to the root of the application where app.js is located and run the command node app. Follow the prompts starting with entering a player name and enjoy the game!
